# 👾 Space Invaders Game

This is a simple 2D space shooting game built with **Python** and **Kivy**. The player controls a spaceship and must shoot down waves of aliens before they reach the bottom of the screen. The project was developed as a group assignment and serves as an introduction to game development using Python GUI frameworks.
